// NOTE: If user already has a ERC20 token, it's important to wrap it inside This
// to make it have ERC20Votes functionality. For the voting contract, it works like this:
// 1. user first calls approve on his own ERC20 to make `amount` spendable by GovernanceWrappedERC20
// 2. Then calls `depositFor` for `amount` on GovernanceWrappedERC20
// After those, Users can now participate in the voting. If user doesn't want to make votes anymore,
// he can call `withdrawTo` to take his tokens back to his ERC20.

// IMPORTANT: In this token, no need to have mint functionality, 
// as it's the wrapped token's responsibility to mint whenever needed
